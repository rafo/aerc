# Vim-Like Keybindings for Aerc

## Introduction

Welcome to my little repository where I try to enhance the [Aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) email client experience with intuitive Vim-like keybindings! Aerc is an exceptional terminal-based email client known for its efficiency and simplicity. However, I think the developers missed an opportunity in its default setup â€“ the lack of Vim-standard keybindings, which are beloved by many for their speed and convenience.

## About aerc-vim

Aerc-vim is dedicated to bridging that gap by introducing a set of Vim-like keybindings to Aerc. My aim is to make Aerc not only more accessible to Vim users but also to enhance the overall user experience by leveraging the efficiency of Vim's keyboard-driven commands.

## Current Status

Please note, this project is a work in progress. I am constantly refining and improving the keybindings to ensure they feel natural and intuitive for both Vim veterans and newcomers.
