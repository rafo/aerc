# Vim-Like Keybindings for Aerc

## Introduction

Welcome to our repository where we enhance the Aerc email client experience with intuitive Vim-like keybindings! Aerc is an exceptional terminal-based email client known for its efficiency and simplicity. However, we noticed a missed opportunity in its default setup â€“ the lack of Vim-standard keybindings, which are beloved by many for their speed and convenience.

## About This Repository

This project is dedicated to bridging that gap by introducing a set of Vim-like keybindings to Aerc. Our aim is to make Aerc not only more accessible to Vim users but also to enhance the overall user experience by leveraging the efficiency of Vim's keyboard-driven commands.

## Current Status

Please note, this project is a work in progress. We're constantly refining and improving the keybindings to ensure they feel natural and intuitive for both Vim veterans and newcomers.
